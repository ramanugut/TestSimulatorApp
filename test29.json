        "explanation": "<p><strong>1. Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:</strong> Problem: Each invoice with multiple line items would repeat the same invoice-related data (e.g., invoice number, invoice date, customer name) across multiple rows. Impact: This increases the likelihood of inconsistent data if one row's invoice-related information (like the date or customer name) is incorrectly modified without updating the others. <strong>2. Increased Storage and Maintenance Overhead:</strong> Problem: Storing repeated information (such as customer details and invoice numbers) across multiple rows wastes storage space. Impact: This could lead to inefficient data management because queries retrieving invoice details would process redundant data, impacting performance, especially as the table grows. <strong>3. Complicated Updates and Deletions:</strong> Problem: If invoice-level information (like changing the customer name or invoice date) needs to be updated, the system would need to update multiple rows. Impact: Update anomalies could occur if some rows are updated while others are not, leading to inconsistent or partial updates. Similarly, deleting an invoice would require deleting multiple rows, increasing the risk of errors. <strong>Summary:</strong> Combining the INVOICES and INVOICE_LINE tables would introduce the following issues: Data redundancy and inconsistency due to repeated invoice-related data. Increased storage and performance overhead from duplicated data. Complex updates and deletions, leading to update anomalies and errors.</p>"
