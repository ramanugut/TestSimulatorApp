        "a. Pule had to save 8 months to reach his goal",

      "correctAnswer": "c. Pule had to save 9 months to reach his goal",
      "explanation": "The loop iterates until 'finalAmount' reaches or exceeds 'totAmount'. Considering the interest added each month and the monthly saving amount, Pule ends up needing 9 months to reach his savings goal of 5000."
