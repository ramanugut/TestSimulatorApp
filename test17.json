Use four arrays of strings called article, noun, verb, and preposition. Create a sentence by selecting a word at random from each array in the following order: article noun verb preposition article noun. As each word is picked, concatenate it to the previous words in the sentence. The words should be separated by spaces. When the completed sentence is output, it should start with a capital letter and end with a period (full stop).\n\nThe arrays should be filled as follows: the article array should contain the articles 'the', 'a', 'one', 'some', and 'any'; the noun array should contain the nouns 'boy', 'girl', 'dog', 'town', and 'car'; the verb array should contain the verbs 'drove', 'jumped', 'ran', 'walked', and 'skipped'; the preposition array should contain the prepositions 'to', 'from', 'over', 'under', and 'on'.\n\nThe program should generate 20 sentences to form a short story and output the results to an HTML textarea. The story should begin with a line reading 'Once upon a time ...' and end with a line reading 'THE END'.",
