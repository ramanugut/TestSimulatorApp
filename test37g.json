      "options": ["Spontaneous generation", "Gray hole", "Black hole", "Black box"],
      "correctAnswer": "Spontaneous generation",
      "explanation": "A spontaneous generation process in a DFD produces data flows without receiving any input, which is logically impossible."

      "options": ["Primary key", "Concatenated key", "Candidate key", "Secondary key"],
      "correctAnswer": "Candidate key",
      "explanation": "A candidate key is a minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify an entity instance."

      "text": "A field of an entity that has the potential to serve as a primary key can best be described as a _____ key.",
      "options": ["Referential", "Concatenated", "Candidate", "Secondary"],
      "correctAnswer": "Candidate",
      "explanation": "Candidate keys are attributes that can potentially serve as a primary key due to their uniqueness."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which of the following best relates to ensuring referential integrity in a database table?",
      "options": ["Secondary key", "Foreign key", "Combination key", "Integrity key"],
      "correctAnswer": "Foreign key",
      "explanation": "A foreign key maintains referential integrity by linking records in one table to valid entries in another."

      "options": ["Data store", "Process", "Data flow", "Entity"],
      "correctAnswer": "Process",
      "explanation": "‘Print a report’ represents a process that produces output data from stored or input information."
    },
    {
      "text": "In a data flow diagram (DFD), a printed report of PPE received can best be described as a(n) _____.",
      "options": ["Data store", "Process", "Data flow", "Entity"],
      "correctAnswer": "Data flow",
      "explanation": "The printed report represents data leaving the system, which is classified as a data flow."

      "text": "Using Gane and Sarson naming conventions, ESSENTIAL WORKERS in a data flow diagram (DFD) is an example of a(n) _____.",
      "options": ["Data store", "Process", "Data flow", "Entity"],
      "correctAnswer": "Entity",
      "explanation": "External entities, such as ESSENTIAL WORKERS, interact with the system and exchange data."
    },
    {
      "text": "In terms of data flow diagrams, which of the following best describes a SINK?",
      "options": ["Data store", "Process", "Data flow", "Entity"],
      "correctAnswer": "Entity",
      "explanation": "A sink is an external entity that receives data from the system but does not provide input back."
    },
    {
      "text": "In terms of data flow diagrams, which of the following best describes a TERMINATOR?",
      "options": ["Data store", "Process", "Data flow", "Entity"],
      "correctAnswer": "Entity",
      "explanation": "A terminator represents an external entity that interacts with the system as a source or sink of data."
    },
    {
      "text": "In terms of data flow diagrams, which of the following can best be described as a SOURCE?",
      "options": ["Data store", "Process", "Data flow", "Entity"],
      "correctAnswer": "Entity",
      "explanation": "A source is an external entity that supplies data to the system."
    },
    {
      "text": "Analysts often use decision tables to describe a(n) _____ and ensure that they have considered all possible situations.",
      "options": ["Data store", "Entity", "Data flow", "Process"],
      "correctAnswer": "Process",
      "explanation": "Decision tables help define the logic and outcomes of processes by mapping conditions and actions."
